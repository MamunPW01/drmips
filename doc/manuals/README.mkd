Manuals
=======

This directory contains the manuals/documentation (or the sources to create 
them) to be distributed with the simulator.

The manuals were created using [LaTeX][latex].

Each manual should have only one *.tex* file.
The names of the *.tex* files must be listed in the `set(SRC ...)` line of the
*CMakeLists.txt* file to be compiled.
