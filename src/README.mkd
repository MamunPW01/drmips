Source code
===========

This directory contains the source code of the simulator.
It has two subdirectories:

* **android**: source code of the Android version ([Eclipse][ec] project with
  the [ADT plugin][adt]).
* **pc**: source code of the PC version ([NetBeans][nb] project in [Java][java]).

Some important notes:

* The source code was indented with tabs (1 tab = 1 level of indentation).
* The code of the **mips**, **util** and **exceptions** packages (inside the
  **org.feup.brunonova.drmips** package) is *platform independent*.
  It should be exactly the same for both PC and Android versions (changes made
  in one version should be copied to the other) and it shouldn't call any
  platform dependent methods (like methods in the **gui** package).
