Contributing to DrMIPS
======================

The simulator is licensed under the GPLv3, so you are free to use it, modify it
and improve it.
Here are some ways to contribute:


## Translating

The simulator needs to be translated to more languages. You are welcome to
translate it to yours, then send the translation through a pull request or
through the [issue tracker][issues].

There are several files and folders containing translatable string:

*   Strings of the PC version: these are Java properties files and are located
    in `src/pc/lang/*.properties`.
*   Strings of the Android version: these are XML files and are located in
    `src/android/src/main/res/values*/strings.xml`.
    Some strings appear in both PC and Android versions, so please keep them
    consistent.
*   Custom component descriptions in the CPU files: these are JSON files and are
    located in `src/simulator/cpu/*.cpu`.
    The custom descriptions are JSON objects identified by the `"desc"` keyword.
*   User manuals: these are HTML files and are located in `doc/manuals/`.
*   Linux desktop launcher: it's located in `misc/drmips.desktop`.
*   Linux manpages: they are located in `misc/drmips*.1`.


## Coding

You are welcome to fix bugs or add new features.
Find bugs that need to be fixed in the [issue tracker][issues].

The project is arranged into these directories:

*   **doc**: documentation of the project.
    -   **manuals**: user manuals.
    -   **UML**: simple UML class diagram of the simulator.
*   **src**: source code of the project.
    -   **android**: code of the Android application (Android Studio project).
    -   **pc**: code of the PC application (Netbeans project).
    -   **simulator**: code of the simulation logic (Netbeans project), used by
        the other two projects.
*   **misc**: some miscellaneous files used mainly for Linux packages.

Some important notes:

*   The source code was indented with tabs.
*   The code of the **simulator** project is *platform independent*.
    It should not call any platform dependent methods!

To get an idea of how the code is structured, you can look at the simplified 
UML class diagram (it may not be up to date):

## Documentation

You are welcome to improve the user manuals. They are located in `doc/manuals/`
and are HTML files.


## Design

The simulator uses a simple icon that was generated by the Android SDK. A new
and better icon would be appreciated.

You could also improve the design and theming of the simulator.
